# PyMorse
**Author:** Divjot Singh

## Project Statement

Python utility facilitating the conversion of audio input or English text into Morse code, offering a flexible solution for encoding messages. Employs audio processing libraries for seamless audio-to-text conversion and utilizes string manipulation techniques to translate text into Morse code. Enhances communication capabilities by providing a reliable means of Morse code encoding.

## Pre-Requisites:

- Audio Input Device
- Required Modules

## Base Structure:

The project architecture consists of two core components; a  `primary program file` and subsequently, a `requirements.txt` file delineating essential dependencies.

- **Source File (`Morse.py`):** This file encompasses critical functionalities including a reference dictionary for Morse code, an audio input module facilitating audio capture mode, and an input-to-Morse converter. Each function is meticulously designed to ensure efficient processing and accurate conversion.

- **Configuration File (`requirements.txt`):** The requirements.txt file serves as a comprehensive registry, enumerating all necessary modules alongside their respective versions essential for seamless execution of the program. Maintaining this file guarantees consistent and reliable performance across diverse computing environments.

## Dependencies:
Please check `requirements.txt` file. This program is to be run in a virtual environment with `requirements.txt` dependencies installed.
